# storefront

## Overview

This is an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL integration. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from inventory. It will include a sepertate mode that will track product sales accross departments and then provide a summary of the gross-sales by department in the store.

The basic bamazonCustomer.js will allow the user to view current products and stock levels, as well as make purchases of products up to but not beyond stock levels.

bamazonManager.js will allow the user to view current products and stock levels, view items with an inventory below 5 (low inventory), add inventory to a product, and add an entirely new product. This is considered the level 2 challenge.

bamazonSupervisor.js will allow the user to view current product sales by department, as well as create a new department to track. This is considered the level 3 challenge.

Full demo of each phase is available here --
